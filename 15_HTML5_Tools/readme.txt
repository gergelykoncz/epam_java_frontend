Check out the example PokeAPI project we used in the classroom at:
https://github.com/gergelykoncz/epam_frontend_notes/tree/requirejs/TaskRunners

Things to play with:
- Run the JSHint static analyzer with gulp jshint
- Run the Jasmine test with gulp karma
    - Check out the syntax and know the concepts (describe = suite, it = test, beforeEach, etc.)
- Check out the module loader syntax (RequireJS)
    - The configuration of RequireJS is waaay out of scope, don't waste time on that.
